~~1. get es6 modules working (vis-js) convert to svg-pan-zoom and display.~~
Urgent needs:
fix concurrency pools tab and worker info tab
I broke the buttons on the flow page again - sorry
make the system summary table not look comically small
For these, im fairly certain my sql files and the way i refactored the python and the run.py are not the issues. I believe it is some javascript/html issues in displaying them.

Next week todo:
flow configurator,
more information about the orchestrator? not sure what else would be needed


3. select flows that have been run
4. run a flow by name (arguments would be nice)
5. configure via json
6.
