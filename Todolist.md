~~1. get es6 modules working (vis-js) convert to svg-pan-zoom and display.~~
Urgent needs:
in the pool tab of the orch dashboard, want to have a details button 
that shows all the tasks and their info that the pool is working on.
should be useful to see bottlenecks. after that, not sure what to do 
with the worker info tab, kinda redundant after that. Maybe some stats
about the workers and a quick view of potential bottlenecks? hard to say.
also for the log, some filtering would be a good idea, like a way to filter it to show all the logs between certain times, like show all logs between 12 am to 6 pm. after that, orchestrator dashboard should be done.
also, havent given it a button on the main page yet. to check out the orch page just change the url to have /orchestrator.html


add levels to log
add more filtering to log

Next week todo:
flow configurator,
more information about the orchestrator? not sure what else would be needed


3. select flows that have been run
4. run a flow by name (arguments would be nice)
5. configure via json
6.
